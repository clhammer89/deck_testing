Getting started: <br>
Make sure you have python3 installed <br>
Build a deck at https://lorcana.gg/deck and use the "Copy Text" button to copy your deck <br>
<br>
pip install -r requirements.txt <br>
python app.py <br>
<br>
That should open a tab in your browser. Either paste your deck line by line or use the lorcana.gg deck output and paste it, then hit submit <br>
You can now view your deck, add cards to your hand and use the buttons on the card to move your cards around. <br>
Use Load Assets to download the card pictures for use <br>
