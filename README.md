Getting started: \n
\n
Make sure you have python3 installed \n
Build a deck at https://lorcana.gg/deck and use the "Copy Text" button to copy your deck \n

pip install -r requirements.txt \n
python app.py \n

That should open a tab in your browser. Either paste your deck line by line or use the lorcana.gg deck output and paste it, then hit submit \n
You can now view your deck, add cards to your hand and use the buttons on the card to move your cards around. \n
Use Load Assets to download the card pictures for use \n
